HTML and CSS code for Blogger websites

**Title:** Custom CSS code for blogs built on the Blogger platform

**Description:** The content of these CSS files can be used to customize the look and feel of a Blogger blog. It includes a variety of features, such as custom colors, fonts, and layouts. 
All style sheets are rendered correctly on all devices since I added @media rule to all relevant HTML elements. 

**How to use:**

1. Find **Theme** in the main menu.
2. Click on **Customize** under **My Theme** (orange button);
3. Go to **Advanced** and scroll all the way down till you see the option **Add CSS**;
4. Copy the contents of the CSS file and paste it into the text box, then click **Save**.
